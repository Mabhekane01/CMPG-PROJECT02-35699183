## Describtion
I have created the GET and POST methods for Devices, Zones and Categories in separate controllers?
I have created the PUT and DELETE methods for Devices, Zones and Categories in separate controllers?
I have created a GET method that gets the devices based on a category ID being parsed in?
I have created a GET method that will return the number of zones that are associated to a specific category.
I have created a GET method that retrieves all devices within a specific zone (based on the zone ID that is parsed through)?
I have created a method that checks if an item exists before trying to edit or delete the item (applied to Devices, Zones, and Categories)?
And in order to use the CRUB methods, I have implemented swagger which will act as a gui and each time a user uses the GRUB they will have to do authorization which is used to protect the datastores.
All relevent security and features have  been implemented according to the given instructions.
